            <h3>Day-to-Day Benefits</h3>
            <p>Day-to-day claims are paid at 100% of the Agreed Tariff (AT), from the
annual Medical Savings Account (MSA) - 20% of annual contributions.
Once the savings have been depleted, claims are payable from the
Annual Flexi Benefit (AFB) - 5% of annual contributions, where after
the member is liable for the Self Payment Gap (SPG). During this period
claims will accumulate to the threshold level at the Agreed Tariff, without
the member being refunded. Once the threshold level is reached, the
member will qualify for an above threshold benefit of R6 360 p/b, and
R12 720 p/f, with specified sub-limits.</p>
