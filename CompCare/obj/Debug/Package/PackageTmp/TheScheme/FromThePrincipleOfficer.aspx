            <p>
                Choosing the right medical scheme for you is one of the most important decisions
                you could ever make. After all, your health is your most precious asset and while
                it is ultimately your responsibility, it may at times rest in the hands of others.
                It is at times like this that you would want a medical scheme you can rely on. 
            </p>

                all the boxes 
            </h5>
            <p>
                So how do you know who to trust with your health? There are many factors
                that need to be considered including financial soundness, a proven track record
                and benefits that meet your specific needs. With a proud history spanning more than
                30 years, consistently good solvency ratios and six different benefit options to
                choose from, CompCare Wellness meets all these conditions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But there is more to
                this scheme than its credentials. At CompCare we understand that no two members
                are ever the same and individual needs are never overlooked. A strong emphasis is
                also placed on ensuring that healthcare funding decisions are based on medical evidence
                with a caring approach. 
            </p>
            <h5>
                Making a real difference in members’ lives 
            </h5>
            <p>
                CompCare offers
                benefits that many other medical schemes do not provide cover for, such as a laser
                eye surgery benefit for visual defects, as well as cover for attention deficit disorder
                (ADD) treatment on comprehensive options. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And while most medical schemes refuse
                to provide cover to professional sportsmen and sportswomen, CompCare is proud to
                serve the sporting heroes that are such an integral part of South Africa’s identity.
                </p>
            <p>
                The health of female members is another important focus for CompCare and we therefore
                offer a contraceptive benefit on most options, with additional cover for cervical
                cancer vaccination and osteoporosis treatment on comprehensive options. 
            </p>

                in 2011 
            </h5>
            <p>
                In 2011, CompCare managed to keep increases down to well below the market
                average while introducing a number of benefit enhancements as well as new benefits.
                Two exciting new benefits that were rolled out across all options were: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>&nbsp;Full cover
                for consultations and procedures at hospital emergency rooms and casualties for
                acute injuries, without co-payments by the member at point of service; and </li>
                <li>An
                unlimited and individualised oncology benefit, subject to the member’s hospital
                benefit, that ensures he or she gets access to the best available care in the event
                of a life-threatening cancer illness. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As always, CompCare remains fully committed
                to its members and we warmly welcome any new members into the CompCare fold. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Wishing
                you all the best for the year ahead! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Kindest regards,
